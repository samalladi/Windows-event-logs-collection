# Windows-event-logs-collection
The below powershell script is very useful during Incident reponse. It grabs necessary event logs:
"Application", "System", "Security", "Windows Firewall With Advanced Security", "TerminalServices", "RemoteConnectionManager Operational", 
"Bits-Client Operational", "TaskScheduler Operational", 
"Windows PowerShell Operational", "Windows Defender Operational", "Windows Powershell"), netstat, firewall rules, process, scheduled tasks, services etc..

All these are collected and placed on Desktop under IR folder.
